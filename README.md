# KagglePredictFutureSales
https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview

My goal was to explore gradient boosting in the spark ML library. 
Below is the description of the Kaggle competition:

**This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

**In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

**We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.

***Note: Even though the competition is more suited for a time-series model. I went ahead with gradient boost for the sake of learning and exploring the concept.

The model I built scored 2.38 on Kaggle.
